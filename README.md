This day marks the start of my first addition to the GitHub repository. I am a graduate with a B.S. Marketing from NDSU and have been working at Microsoft for the past 2 years. I am on the Azure team and currently learning more about Python to prepare myself for acceptance into a Master of Science in Business Analytics program. I completed my first Python 208x course last night and am excited to continue learning.
